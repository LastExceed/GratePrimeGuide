# Title

With strength, endurance, patience, dedication and sacrifice you have proven yourself. Proven to be worthy of owning the Grate Prime. But that alone is only half the cake. Because what is the point of owning the Grate Prime when you don't have any mods for it? Sure, there's its fashion frame aspect and the unparalleled bragging rights it brings along, but lets be real here: If you've made it this far then of course you don't want to leave it unfinished.

Being a specific type of equipment on its own Grate Prime also uses its own mods. They are a completely different cathegory of mods (like primed, sacrifical, umbral, riven, or peculiar) called "grate-r" mods. They are green and need to be crafted. But before we can craft them, we need the Grate-r mods foundry segment. The blueprint for this segment is awarded from completing the "Grate-r glory" quest which is unlocked upon aquiring Grate Prime.

# Grate-r glory

Grate-r glory begins at Teshin in any relay (except Janus) and your first task is to max out your conclave standing. that is, reach the rank of tempest and fill your standing all the way up to 125k. Next, Teshin will ask you to prove your superiority one last time, by giving you a particularly hard task for each conclave gamemode: In annihilation you have to win a game without killing anyone or getting killed yourself. In team annihilation you have to achieve a deathless victory alone, and in cephalon capture you have to win a game by capturing all cephalons yourself while not letting the enemy team even touch your cephalon a single time. Lunaro didn't exist back then so there's no task for that. After you've shown your absolute dominance over the tenno Teshin will hand out the grate-r mods foundry segment blueprint. Crafting it costs half a million ferrite and a credit and takes the usual 12 hours.

# Cephalons

Next, we need to get the blueprints for the mods themselves. Since there is no serial production for grate-r mods but only custom-made editions, you will have to ask cephalon samodeus personally for the blueprint. But how do we even contact the inventor of mods himself? After all he "lives" a pretty withdrawn live and decided to disconnect from the weave a long time ago. However, he does have a datascape like Simaris' simulacrum or Ordis' captura scenes, which can be accessed from Janus. But before you waste another 100 Argon crystals on crafting a key to go there you should know that Samodeus doesn't usually welcome any guests. To enter his datascape you need a recommendation from 7 cephalons:
- Ordis will happily do whatever the operator considers necessary without second thought.
- Simaris is always up for everything if it means new knowledge for the sanctuary. just hearing about custom edition mods by master Samodeus got his ~~heart racing~~ cpu overclocked
- Suda will ask you to prove yourself worthly of meeting the old master by maxing out her syndicate.
- Sark will want to see you defeat John Prodman solo
- Jordas didn't exist yet, but it would probably be very difficult to get a recommendation from an infested cephalon anyway so we don't bother about him
- Apnar and Vull will be convinced by your previously established domination in Teshins final conclave challenge

But what about Cordylon? Space-moms right hand hasn't shown himself in almost 3 years and even back then when he was still around it was already pretty hard to even have your presence aknowledged by him.

- use loki
- go to janus
- enter samodeus data scape

# Samodeus' datascape

A feast for the eyes. A sight that simaris would delete the sanctuary for. Piles over piles of mods are scattered all round the datascape. primed mods. riven mods. peculiar mods even. But no grate-r mods. Samodeus doesn't even bother paying his visitor attention as you trip on a primed continuity, he's way too focused on working on his next creation. But a loki waving around an actual grate prime? that gets even his attention. Not much is said, samodeus can already tell what you're here for. but before he hands out his most precious creations he wants to make sure that you truly value a custom work from the old master and wont just sell it off for platinum the moment you finished crafting it.

He'll ask to see your codex entries so I hope you have your mod collection complete because Samodeus won't be amused if you haven't even collected half of his mass produced mods yet. If however you can show how much you admire him by proving that you own every single one of his creations that went into serial production, then he will hand out the first blueprint: [Particle]. proven worthy of being an apprentice to the old master you're sent off with the first blueprint of a grate-r mod. make sure you go back to janus when you leave the datascape as we need to grab some crafting materials before we leave. After all crafting grate-r mods requires corrupted ducats instead of credits, and harrow ki'teers kiosk is the only place to get those. 

# The corrupted ducat kiosk

This kiosk doesn't eat normal prime parts like we're used to at Baros kiosk. this one only accepts exclusive prime parts. If you happen to be a founder then now would be the time to say goodbye to excalibur prime, but if you aren't, well, remember when you had to pay Harrow Ki'teer that crazy amount of 9001 platinum for Grate Prime? yeah thats cute, now have fun getting your hands on primed chamber.

Compared to that the remaining crafting components are easy. you need 100 skanas and a prodman autograph, the crafting duration is the usual 12 hours. Why the prodman autograph you may wonder. Didn't you notice the way john prodman appears in the index? "a beam of light" ? Guess what what is. After all you don't become Nef Anyo's employee of the month by just not dying from an encounter with Phorid. John Prodman managed to steal a prototype of [Particle] from samodeus when [simaris fucked up] and equipped it on his prova (which FYI is just a repurposed normal grate to lower equipment expenses for the corpus army).
