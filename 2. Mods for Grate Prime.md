# Title

With strength, endurance, patience, dedication and sacrifice you have proven yourself. Proven to be worthy of owning the Grate Prime. But that alone is only half the cake. Because what is the point of owning the Grate Prime when you don't have any mods for it? Sure, there's its fashion frame aspect and the unparalleled bragging rights it brings along, but lets be real here: If you've made it this far then of course you don't want to leave it unfinished.

Being a specific type of equipment on its own Grate Prime also uses its own mods. They are a completely different cathegory of mods (like primed, sacrifical/umbral, amalgam, riven, or peculiar) called "grate-r" mods. They are green and need to be crafted. But before you can craft them, you need the Grate-r mods foundry segment. The blueprint for this segment is awarded from completing the "Grate-r glory" quest which is unlocked upon aquiring Grate Prime.

# Grate-r glory

Grate-r glory begins at Teshin in any relay (except Janus) and your first task is to max out your conclave standing. that is, reach the rank of tempest and fill your standing all the way up to 125k. Next, Teshin will ask you to prove your superiority one last time, by giving you a particularly hard task for each conclave gamemode: In FFA annihilation you have to get a pacifism win, that means winning a game without killing anyone or getting killed yourself. In team annihilation you have to become a "one man army": achieve a deathless victory alone. In cephalon capture you have to win a game by capturing all cephalons yourself while not letting the enemy team even touch your cephalon a single time. Lunaro didn't exist back then so there's no task for that. After you've shown your absolute dominance over the conclave, Teshin will hand out the grate-r mods foundry segment blueprint. Crafting it costs half a million ferrite and a credit and takes the usual 12 hours.

# Cephalons

Next, you need to get the blueprints for the mods themselves. Since there is no serial production for grate-r mods but only custom-made editions, you will have to ask cephalon samodeus personally for the blueprint. But how do we even contact the inventor of mods himself? After all he "lives" a pretty withdrawn life and decided to disconnect from the weave a long time ago. However, he does have a datascape like Simaris' simulacrum or Ordis' captura scenes, which can be accessed from Janus. But before you waste another 100 Argon crystals on crafting a Janus key to go there you should know that Samodeus doesn't usually welcome any guests and thus sealed the entry to his datascape. To enter you need a recommendation from 7 cephalons:
- Ordis will happily do whatever the operator considers necessary without second thought.
- Simaris is always up for everything if it means new knowledge for the sanctuary. just hearing about custom edition mods by master Samodeus got his ~~heart racing~~ cpu overclocked
- Suda will ask you to prove yourself worthly of meeting the old master by maxing out her syndicate.
- Sark will want to see you defeat John Prodman solo
- Jordas didn't exist yet, but the only way to get the recommendation from an infested Cephalon would probably be joining the infestations hivemind so we better leave him alone.
- Apnar and Vull will be convinced by your previously established domination in Teshins final conclave challenge

But what about Cordylon? Space-moms right hand hasn't shown himself in over 3 years and even back then when he was still around it was already pretty hard to even have your presence aknowledged by him.

In his last words before disappearing Cordylon hinted at going to the simulacrum, so we should probably do just that. Make sure to unequip Grate Prime before you walk past Simaris, who knows what that totally-not-a-sadist is up to when he sees such a legendary object. And lets be real here, as soon as any tenno sees you carrying Grate Prime around the relay, region chat will blow up your inbox and you won't be getting anywhere.
Once you're inside the simulacrum, if you haven't already, equip Loki. Why? Because choosy Lokis choose Grate Prime of course. After that equip Grate Prime again. The moment you do so the simulacrum glitches. Obviously Simaris' datascape isn't able to handle Grate Prime so it hangs up and crashes, trapping you in the virtual space that is now nothingness, located somewhere on the vast Cephalon network, also known as **The Weave**.

# The Weave

Of course this security breach didn't go unnoticed, a physical or even organic entity should never have access to the weave directly. But luckily, as the Cephalon responsible for organizing and cataloging The Lotus' data (which is basically the sum of all Cephalon data) Cordylon is also the system admin responsible for handling database breaches such as the shutdown of the Sanctuary you just caused, which is why he is the one that awaits you on the Weave by the time you come to yourself. You now notice that Cordylon planned all of this happening every since his disappearance on March 22nd 2015 and has just been waiting for a tenno to make it happen ever since. So obviously you ask him what the hell he's up to, but just like Hunhow's daughter he stays very secretive about his intentions. He does however show you how to access Samodeus' datascape as promised so you don't bother him about it any further.

# Samodeus' datascape

A feast for the eyes. A sight that simaris would delete the sanctuary for. Piles over piles of mods are scattered all round the datascape. primed mods. amalgam mods. riven mods. peculiar mods even. The more you look around the more unique and unreleased mods you spot. But no grate-r mods. Samodeus doesn't even bother paying his visitor attention as you trip on a stack of [Affinity Amp] aura mods, he's way too focused on working on his next creation. But a loki waving around an actual grate prime? that gets even his attention. Not much is said, samodeus can already tell what you're here for. but before he hands out his most precious creations he wants to make sure that you truly value a custom work from the old master and wont just sell it off for platinum the moment you finished crafting it.

He'll demand to see your codex entries so I hope you have your mod collection complete because Samodeus won't be amused if you haven't even collected half of his mass produced mods yet. If however you can show how much you admire him by proving that you own every single one of his creations that went into serial production, then he will hand out the first blueprint: [Particle]. proven worthy of being an apprentice to the old master you're sent off with the first blueprint of a grate-r mod. make sure you go back to janus when you leave the datascape as we need to grab some crafting materials before we leave. After all crafting grate-r mods requires corrupted ducats instead of credits, and harrow ki'teers kiosk is the only place to get those. 

# The corrupted ducat kiosk

This kiosk doesn't eat normal prime parts like we're used to at Baro's kiosk. this one only accepts EXCLUSIVE prime parts. If you happen to be a founder then now would be the time to say goodbye to excalibur prime, but if you aren't, well, remember when you had to pay Harrow Ki'teer that crazy amount of 9001 platinum for Grate Prime? yeah thats cute, now have fun getting your hands on [primed chamber].

# John Prodman

Compared to that the remaining crafting components are easy. you need 100 skanas and a prodman autograph, the crafting duration is the usual 12 hours. Why the prodman autograph you may wonder. Didn't you notice the way john prodman appears in the index? "a beam of light" ? Guess what that is. After all you don't become Nef Anyo's employee of the month just by not dying from an encounter with Phorid. John Prodman managed to steal a prototype of [Particle] from samodeus and equipped it on his prova (which by the way is just a repurposed normal grate to lower equipment expenses for the corpus army). How a regular corpus crewman managed to steal the digital property of a cephalon? It would have been an act of the impossible if it wasn't for one of Simaris' fuckups. Being a dutiful and perfectly responsible Cephalon in terms of software security as we know him, Simaris kept postponing security updates to avoid having to reboot the simulacrum while recording his "Epic 10k Crewman vs Eidolon Hydrolyst battle" simulation for his TennoTube channel. Eventually the system just forcefully installed the updates and rebooted the simulacrum in the middle of the fight, leaking all the simulated entities onto the Weave. Since Simaris was now locked behind the endless loading screen of the installing updates, it was Cordylon of course who then had to clean up Simaris' mess (as always). Cordylon was too busy taking care of the giant Sentient creature that was now wrecking havoc on the weave to notice that little crewman sneaking into samodeus' datascape to steal his newest creation. This was the point in time where Samodeus decided to disconnect from the Weave, and maybe also partly the reason why Cordylon holds such a grudge against Simaris.

# Particle

Once [Particle] finished crafting it's time to flex on your fellow Tenno with what looks like an extreme version of the stalkers smoking body ephemera during mission entry. And when you're done realizing that most people dont even notice it as everyone skips the intro cutscene anyway you can get back down to earth to finish what you started. Because it's time to acquire the most OP of the grate-r mods: [Shockwave].
