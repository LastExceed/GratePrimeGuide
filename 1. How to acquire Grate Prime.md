##April 1st 2014

First of all, lets clear up the mystery around the 1 confirmed grate prime purchase. Be warned though, as the truth isn't that exciting. set your expectations accordingly.

It is often assumed that the reason for there just being a single purchase is because of the crazy price and the fact that it was only available for 60 seconds. But why is there no footage of the offer in the market at least? 60 seconds is more than enough time to take a screenshot, and even if not, think about live streamers or anyone using ShadowPlay. considering the huge player base of warframe there should be lots and lots of accidental footage of grate prime being featured in the market. yet there is none. why is that? To answer this question, we first need to address a common misconception about the initial release of grate prime. the wiki says "The Grate Prime was available for purchase in the market only on April 1, 2014 for 9001 platinum for 60 seconds after the first log in". but with the first login they didn't mean your first login on April 1st 2014, they meant the first login of the account EVER. Which means you could've only seen it if you played through all the tutorial missions and reached the orbiter within 60 seconds, which is basically impossible. But why did DE decide to make it impossibly hard to get? It's because of the mods. DE was running out of time during development and the mods weren't ready to be released yet. They lacked a parachute asset for [Dropzone] and also realized that a parachute wouldn't make sense in space, [Particle] was extremely CPU intensive because GPU particles weren't a thing yet and [Shockwave] had a bug of dealing true damage instead of blast damage causing the damage output to be a little too high. But at the same time they didn't want to disappoint their users with not having an April fools joke that year (after all this is one of the few releases you cannot delay), so they decided to put it into the game anyway make it impossibly hard to get. Counter to their expectation however one user by the name xXxL33TH4X0R420xXx managed to create an account, get through the tutorial, unlock the market, level to Mastery Rank 2, craft a clan key, trade 9001 plat from another account and purchase grate prime within the 60 seconds margin. How he did it? Again, like all real world mysteries the answer is pretty boring: He was a hacker. and he got banned before he thought of taking a screenshot.

And that's the story of April 1st 2014. Pretty lame actually, huh? Don't worry, we'll get to the interesting part now as the story doesn't end there:

##Update 15

Do you really think grate prime being featured in the archwing launch was just an easter egg? That there was nothing to it but using an outdated April fools joke to keep the Konami code alive? Don't be foolish. Why would [DE]Rebbecca say that they dare not speak its name "because you never know who's watching" at tennocon2018 (during the Q&A after the art panel)? Because it was a stupid April fools joke from 4 years ago that nobody cares about anymore? No. Grate Prime has actually been silently re-released during the archwing update because the mods were finally fixed. They developed a jet powered parachute for [Dropzone] to make it work in space, replaced [Particle]'s particles with 2D textures to get rid of the performance problems (FYI the introduction of this mod was actually the point in time when the development on GPU particles began, but it took them another 4 years to complete those) and the bug that caused [Shockwave] to deal true damage was finally found (turns out some jackass replaced a semicolon with a greek questionmark).

They no longer had to hide it behind impossible conditions, but they still wanted to make sure that grate prime would only get into the hands of someone worthy of its power. So instead of impossible conditions, they decided to keep the process of acquiring it secret and also making it ridiculously long and hard.

##Conditions

Since it was released with the archwings, the obvious assumption for the first step would be some archwing mission right? wrong. First of all you need to fulfill some conditions. Apart from the obvious ones (for example completing the archwing quest or getting all the codex scans for normal grate) you need to have destroyed 420 plus an integer multiple of 69 grates in your account history. Unfortunately there's no counter for the amount of destroyed grates on your profile so I hope you kept track of that until now. 

After we dealt with the conditions, its time to learn something about the solar system in warframe: Technically speaking warframe has always been an "open world", the tile sets just prevented you from noticing that. because although there's loading screens between missions, all planets and their missions are actually on the same map, just extremely far spread out like real world planets (the loading screens are just loading the new area after your teleport over a huge distance). This means that manual travel to a mission would in theory be possible, there's just one catch to it: most tile sets are closed, and even on open tile sets where you can go outside we're still subject to gravity, so there's no way to really get away from a mission, much less travel all the way to another one. And this is where the archwing becomes important:

##Archwing

There is currently 9 archwing missions in the whole whole solar map, or 8 if we count out the jordas golem assassination because back in 2014 that mission didn't exist yet. half of them are on the trench run tile set, which is completely sealed off with shields, so we can rule those out too. That leaves us with 4 missions that use the free space tile set, which is the only place where we can leave the mission - if it wasn't for the fact that space mom automatically aborts the mission if we fly away too far from the original location, putting us back into the orbiter.

However one of these 4 missions stands out: Pandora on Saturn. It is the only Pursuit mission in the entire game. Isn't that strange? Because normally you can find each mission type on almost every planet. What's also special about Pursuit is that unlike all other free space missions, the distance at which the mission gets aborted isn't based of the tile set (which has a fixed location) but of the ship carrying the blackbox, which moves. You can probably guess where this is going: the ship circles the asteroids based on your location, and with intelligent AI manipulation you can trick the ship to move further and further away from those asteroids, until there are none left in its proximity at which point the ship will just move in a straight line. And its not going in any random direction; its heading towards the void.

##The void

More specifically it's heading towards a certain mission in the void which isn't shown on the solar map. The one mission that all planets but the void have: The Assassination. Follow the ship and make sure to stay close enough in order to not trigger mission abort. The flight will take quite long (about half an hour) but once you're there, you'll find yourself in front of a ventilation shaft leading into the mission, and blocking your way is, in all its glory, a grate prime. But as painful as that sounds you'll actually have to destroy this one to get inside the mission, because this one is actually corrupted by the neural sentry of this tower. Unlike a normal grate however this one doesn't break so easily. You will need an explosive weapon, and quite a few hits until it breaks. Breaking it will trigger the mission start cinematic we've all seen countless times before where the grate falls down and the warframe jumps down from the ventilation shaft, except this time its a grate prime falling down. Take your time to have a good look at it, because next time you encounter it you won't have the time to calmly observe it.

Unlike the assassinations we're used to you won't have to run 1000meters to the assassination target, because you'll find yourself on the map tile used for void defense or interception missions. And your target is waiting for you. But who are you facing there? Corrupted Vor? lol no. Your enemy is the towers lvl 1337 neural sentry itself, equipped with - you name it - corrupted grate prime. This is a brutally hard fight because at each quater step of its HP (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%) the neural sentry will use [Shockwave] dealing the unbelievable 9999999 blast damage (which is pretty much guaranteed to 1shot you) so you you'll have to save up your respawns for that, allowing no other deaths during the fight. And you'll have to be extra careful because if you fail this fight, you'll have to destroy 68 grates before you can try again since you destroyed a grate at the begin of the assassination and thus no longer fulfill the 420+n*69 rule.

##Crafting

You may wonder what the drops of a neural sentry are. There's only a single item that can drop from it: a blueprint. its the blueprint for a foundry segment, the "Janus key segment" to be specific. crafting it costs 50.000.000 credits and a ferrite and takes the usual 12 hours. While it's crafting, we need to get the Janus key blueprint. I hope you have your syndicates maxed, because you will need a sculpture from all syndicates. I recommend to level red veil + perrin sequence + new loka together and then steel meridian + arbiters + suda because this way you can do 3 syndicates at the same time. After you gathered all 6 sculptures its time to collect Kurias. All of them. because you'll need the Kuria statuette which is only awarded upon collecting all 56 Kurias. When you're done with that, go to the round platform in front of your foundry and place the 6 syndicate sculptures in a hexagon. finally, put the kuria statuette in the center. it will vanish (a necessary sacrifice) and in its place the blueprint for the Janus key will appear. One of the crafting components for the Janus key is a clan key, which means you won't be able to enter dojos anymore until you leave an rejoin your clan to get a new blueprint. The other crafting components are an ascaris negator, a Glaive and 100 Argon crystals. Another big problem with the Janus key is that it takes 1 month to craft and cannot be rushed, so you may wanna use this time to sit down and think hard about why you're doing this to yourself.

What next? What can you do with the Janus key? Vor always shoves it in our faces as if it was like a superpower, even though the key itself actually doesn't do much. In fact, the Janus works just like all the other old void keys did: It grants access to a place that is only shown on the solar map when you have the key. You need to know that just like most other planets, the void actually has a relay, called Janus.

##Janus

A month has passed and the wait is finally over. The Janus key has finished crafting and you're ready to enter Janus. Upon arrival you will however quickly realize that the wait has only just begun. Because *he* isn't here. in fact, NOBODY is here. The relay is completely empty and dead silent. No passing landing crafts, no patrolling guards, no syndicate representatives. Not even any signs of anyone ever having been here. It's as if you're the first person to ever set foot in this place. The only thing you find is the "corrupted ducat" kiosk. And just like the ducat kiosks in the normal relays, it displays a countdown. Except it's not the countdown to Baros next arrival, because this countdown is much longer. It's for *his* next arrival, which turns out to be only during the acolytes events.

Disappointed you leave the voids relay, because you basically just missed him and the next acolyte event is probably in a year from now. And the frustration becomes even worse when you realize that Janus has once again disappeared from your solar map as void keys  are single-use and you now have to make a new one. 

##Grate Prime

After an eternity of waiting and a stupid amount of argon crystals the acolytes finally return and it is time you visit Janus once more. It is still completely quiet and everything seems to be exactly how you remember it from your last visit, as the entire time nobody has been here. But something is different. You can fell it. His presence. He's here. You go to the main hall, then to the rooms in back, then back to the landing platform. you search all around the relay, until you stop in the top floor. There he is. In the middle of literally nowhere, the most isolated place of the entire solar system, standing on a little podium. Harrow Ki'teer. And for the next 60 seconds he will be selling for 9001 platinum the Grate Prime.

Writing this guide took me a whole day and a half. I could have gone on forever because I still have lots of ideas, but eventually I figured that this guide is already 2300 words / 13000 characters long and I spent way too much time on this, so I decided to bring it to an end here. For now. I might do a part2 for how to get the mods at some point, depending on how well part1 comes across and whether you'd be willing to also make a video about part2.
